1. Make a list of all the bits of Ruby you can think of.  
2. Sort the list in order of importance. Donâ€™t think about it too much, just whatever feels most important to you to learn. You can always re-order it.  
3. Starting at the top of the list, learn how to do each thing in Javascript.  

# Things I've found translations for
### Variables
You declare a JavaScript variable with the `var` keyword: `var carName;` After the declaration, the variable has no value (technically it has the value of undefined).  Assigning a class object to a variable: `var dog = new Dog();`

### Assignment operators
Hooray! these look to be the same as Ruby ( `= , += , -= , *= `)

### Maths (Addition etc) 
Same as ruby?

### Arrays
Same as ruby  

### Boolean logic operators 
Almost the same as ruby, but notably `==` in JS means equal to, vs. `===` meaning equal value and equal type. Seems like most situations will call for triple equal. 

### [Classes](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/js_classes.md)
`class Dog {}`

### [Methods](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/js_classes.md#defining-methods)
Within a class you can do:
```
someMethodName(some Parameter) {
  // code you want the method to run on the class object. Don't forget a `;`
}
```
[standalone functions and arrow function syntax](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/thermostat_es6/walkthroughs/javascript_basics.md) are also a thing.


### [Instance variables](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/js_classes.md#initialisation-code)
`this.breed = breed;` ?

### [Initialize](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/js_classes.md#initialisation-code)
In JavaScript, the `constructor` method is called.

```
class Dog {
  constructor(breed) {
    this.breed = breed;
  }
}
```

### [attr_readers / accessors](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/js_classes.md#initialisation-code)
In javascript, there are no attr_reader or attr_accessor. Instead, instance variables are accessible to the outside via dot-notation.
 
### running in irb / load ruby
`open SpecRunner.html`
In the same browser window where your SpecRunner.html is loaded up, open your console (Google Chrome shortcut is cmd + option + i) and at the prompt initialise an instance of your class to get going eg `var javabuzz = new Javabuzz();`

### Output functions (return/puts/print/p):
```console.log(`${thing} to print`)```.  Don't forget to use back-ticks for strings that will contain interpolation (`${}`).  

### Still to learn
- Hashes
- If statements  
- Switch statements  
- each loops  
- while loops  
- raise error if..   
- Input functions (gets.chomp / method parameters)  
- Dependency injection  
- Constants  
- spec expect to eq  
- rspec expect to change  
- require file  
- gems
