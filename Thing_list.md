1. Make a list of all the bits of Ruby you can think of.  
2. Sort the list in order of importance. Donâ€™t think about it too much, just whatever feels most important to you to learn. You can always re-order it.  
3. Starting at the top of the list, learn how to do each thing in Javascript.  

~Variables:~ You declare a JavaScript variable with the `var` keyword: `var carName;` After the declaration, the variable has no value (technically it has the value of undefined).
